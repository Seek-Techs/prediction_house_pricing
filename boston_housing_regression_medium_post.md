# 🏡 Predicting Housing Prices: A Hands-On Guide Using Regression Modeling in Python

![Summary Infographic](https://your-link-to-summary-infographic.png)

## ✨ Introduction

Have you ever wondered how machine learning can be used to **predict housing prices**? In this post, we dive into a real-world dataset and apply a variety of regression techniques to model and predict the median value of homes in Boston.

This article is designed to **bridge the gap between technical and non-technical readers**, walking you through the process of model selection, evaluation, tuning, and interpretation. By the end, you'll not only understand how the process works but also how to reproduce it with Python code.

## 📊 Dataset Overview

We used the **Boston Housing Dataset**, which includes **506 records and 13 input variables** describing housing characteristics like crime rate, average number of rooms, property tax rate, and more.

**Target variable**: `MEDV` (Median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000s)

### 🔍 Correlation Insights

Some features show strong relationships:

- `NOX` and `INDUS`: **+0.77**
- `DIS` and `INDUS`: **-0.71**
- `AGE` and `NOX`: **+0.73**
- `DIS` and `NOX`: **-0.78**
- `LSTAT` and `MEDV`: **-0.74**

These correlations guide us on which variables might be most predictive.

## 🛠️ Baseline Modeling with Raw Data

We evaluated six models without scaling:

**Linear Models**:
- Linear Regression (LR): `MSE = -24.05`
- LASSO Regression: `MSE = -28.61`
- ElasticNet: `MSE = -28.63`

**Nonlinear Models**:
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): `MSE = -44.50`
- CART: `MSE = -26.03`
- SVR: `MSE = -71.49`

🧠 *Insight*: Linear Regression had the lowest error, while SVR struggled likely due to unscaled features.

## 🧼 Improving Performance with Standardization

By using `Pipeline` and `StandardScaler`, we scaled the features before model training. The impact?

- KNN: `MSE improved from -44.50 to -25.32`
- SVR: `MSE improved from -71.49 to -31.59`
- LR retained its score: `-24.05`

### 📈 Visualization

## 🔧 Hyperparameter Tuning (KNN)

We tuned KNN using GridSearchCV for `n_neighbors`:

Best result:  
**`n_neighbors=3`** → `MSE = -20.18`

This is a significant boost in performance for KNN.

## 🎯 Ensemble Methods for Better Accuracy

We evaluated the following ensemble models:

- **Boosting**: AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting
- **Bagging**: Random Forest, Extra Trees

**Best Performer**: Extra Trees Regressor  
After tuning `n_estimators`, the best model gave:

```text
Best: -11.39 using {'n_estimators': 300}
```

Final MSE on holdout set: **9.78** (the best so far!)

## 🔍 Residual Analysis

Residuals help assess model bias and variance. Below is a histogram of residuals from Extra Trees:

```python
plt.hist(residuals, bins=20)
plt.xlabel('Residuals')
plt.ylabel('Frequency')
plt.show()
```

🎯 *Interpretation*: Most residuals cluster around zero — a good sign!

## 📌 Conclusion

Through careful data preparation, scaling, model evaluation, tuning, and ensemble learning, we significantly improved prediction accuracy on the Boston Housing dataset. The best performance was achieved using a **tuned Extra Trees Regressor**, with a final **MSE of 9.78**.
